Generic-service
  
    > Generic-Service project implemented with Java Generics concepts and Spring-Data repositor.This combination was enriched the 
      coding and improve the code reusability.
    > The Generic dao code to access the general DAO methods such as find,save,findAll from the Repository will be used for all DAO classes . 
      For example the Contact DAO and Person DAO will inherit all the Generics class methods and provide the same funtionality.
    > So in future if we add more functionalities like that the developer can only inherit the GenericsDao class and implement all the
      existing methods.
